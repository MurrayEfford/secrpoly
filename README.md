# secrpoly

Area Search Spatially Explicit Capture-Recapture

This was an experimental R package. Initially it comprised a subset of code 
from 'secr' related to polygon, polygonX, transect, and transectX detector types. 

Development of 'secrpoly' has been paused because a simpler way was found to 
reduce the installation time and size of 'secr'. The package 'secrfunc' wraps 
C++ code for numerical integration from the package 'RcppNumerical'. From 
version 5.4.0, 'secr' imports 'secrfunc'.

It is likely that the repo 'secrpoly' will be deleted permanently early in 2026.
